"""Install this repo's skills into each agent product's discovery path.

Skills follow the open Agent Skills standard (``SKILL.md`` + progressive disclosure), so the CONTENT
ports across Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI and friends. Only the **discovery path** differs —
which is the entire reason this installer exists and why it is a dumb copier rather than a framework.

    python skills/install.py --list
    python skills/install.py --target claude          # -> .claude/skills/
    python skills/install.py --target agents --user   # -> ~/.agents/skills/
    python skills/install.py --target all --dry-run
    python skills/install.py --check                  # the invariants, for CI and conformance

Symlinks by default so an edit to the repo is live everywhere; ``--copy`` for environments where a
symlink will not do.

``--check`` is what the conformance rule calls, so the command that reports a broken link is also
the command that repairs it. It holds the two COMMITTED discovery paths to three invariants — a
link in both, nothing dangling, every link relative — reports every problem it finds rather than
the first, and names the fix on each one. A repo with no skills passes: this lane ships empty.
