"""Render the template for all three shapes and prove each result is green.

    pixi run dogfood
    python scripts/dogfood.py --rung no-package --keep

TEMPLATE-ONLY. `scripts/init_repo.py` deletes this file, and the `dogfood` job in `ci.yml`
goes with it, because a derived repo has nothing to render.

The only seam that sees `init-repo` at all, since everything that skill does happens to a
*copy*. For each rung: build a scratch repo, run `scripts/init_repo.py` with that rung's four
answers, then hand the result to its OWN gates — `pixi run check` and the docs build — and
assert what they cannot see. The rendered repo's own gate is the assertion, so almost nothing is
asserted here.

Two things about the scratch repo are deliberate:

- It is **re-initialized, not cloned.** GitHub's template button creates a repo with one commit
  holding the whole tree, and `init-repo`'s untouched check compares against that first commit.
  A clone of this repo carries this repo's history instead, under which every file added after
  the initial scaffold reads as modified — so a plain clone would make a fresh repo ask before
  every deletion, which is the opposite of what a template-created repo does.
- It is built from the **working tree**, not from `HEAD`, so this runs against the change you
  are about to commit. In CI the checkout is clean and the two are the same thing.

`pixi install --locked` runs before the gate on purpose. Without it a lock that no longer
matches the manifest is re-solved in silence, and the `no-package` shape — which has to remove
this repo's own editable install from `pixi.lock` — would pass while shipping a lock that says
something else.
