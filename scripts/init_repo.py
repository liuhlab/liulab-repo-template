r"""The mechanical half of `init-repo`: everything the interview does not have to judge.

    python scripts/init_repo.py --shape published --module widget --cli \\
        --description "What this repo is for."
    python scripts/init_repo.py --shape no-package --description "..." --plan

`skills/init-repo/SKILL.md` conducts the interview — four questions, all judgement. This
script performs every action those answers imply, deterministically and without an agent, so
the `dogfood` job can render the template for all three shapes on every pull request and prove
each result is green.

Actions come in two kinds, and only one of them is dangerous:

- **Substitutions always run.** Renaming the placeholder package directory is right whether it
  holds one file or fifty, so a repo initialized eight months late still gets its rename.
- **A deletion or an overwrite runs unprompted only when its target is byte-identical to the
  first commit.** A template-created repo starts with one commit, so
  `git diff --quiet <first commit> -- <path>` settles that exactly rather than heuristically.
  Otherwise it asks, and the default is keep. `--plan` prints the same survey and changes
  nothing; `--force <path>` acts on a changed target anyway, for a caller that has already
  asked the person.

Exempt from that check, deleted unconditionally and tolerated when absent: the two skill
directories, their four symlinks, the `dogfood` job and its task, `scripts/dogfood.py`, this
file, the two files that publish this repo as the template — `docs/template/index.md` and the
`mkdocs.template.yml` that names the site after it — and the template's own records, the ADR and
the three research notes that say how the template was built. Their removal is the entire point,
so nothing about them is negotiable.
`CHANGELOG.md` is the one record handled the other way: the file always ships, and emptying it
of the template's entries is guarded, so a late init never discards what someone wrote.

Everything else is an ANCHORED edit: it matches text the template ships and reports a miss
rather than failing. A repo that rewrote the passage keeps what it wrote, and the one thing
that must not survive — the placeholder name — is checked by conformance rule 1 in the
rendered repo, so a missed anchor turns the dogfood job red instead of shipping quietly.

The `no-package` shape prunes more than the spec's `src/` and `tests/`, because those two
deletions alone do not leave a green repo: pixi cannot install a package with no source,
pytest exits 5 on a `tests/` that is not there, and `zensical build --strict` fails on four
mkdocstrings references to a module that is gone. `prune_package` is that list, and every
entry is there because something went red without it.

Limitation, recorded on purpose: a repo seeded by clone-and-push, or whose history was
squashed, reads as fully modified, so it errs toward asking rather than deleting.

#: The template's placeholder identity, SPELLED IN TWO PIECES for the reason
#: `scripts/conformance.py` spells it that way, and one more: a person who renames the tree by

#:
#: BY EXACT PATH, never by directory or glob. A repo initialized late may already have written
#: `docs/adr/0002-*.md` or a research note of its own, and deleting `docs/adr/` would take it
#: with these. Both directories are allowed to disappear with their last file: `Repo.delete`
#: prunes what it empties, and `docs/agents/domain.md` says `/domain-modeling` creates
