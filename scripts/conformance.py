"""The conformance check: the rules a Liu Lab repo keeps after it leaves the template.

    pixi run conformance
    python scripts/conformance.py [--root PATH]

It states the RULE, not the file contents — a pull model, so a repo that legitimately diverges
stays green while the shared conventions stay checked. Eleven rules: nine fail, two only warn.

Three things it does on purpose:

- **It collects every failure.** One run tells you everything to fix, the same idiom
  `scripts/check.sh` uses. Nothing short-circuits.
- **It names the rule and a fix.** You should never have to read this file to act on its output,
  so nothing here prints a rewritten assert.
- **It says what it did NOT check.** A rule whose premise is absent is vacuous, not failing — a
  repo with no `src/` is not a repo that failed to have tests — but a vacuous rule looks exactly
  like a passing one, so each is reported and says why.

The declared agent-facing set is `[tool.liulab.agent-docs]` in `pyproject.toml`: keys are plain
path prefixes matched against `git ls-files`, values name the Vale Length rule that applies or
`false` where none does. Rules 2 and 3 both read it, so the two consumers cannot drift.

Waivers are `[tool.liulab.waived]`, keyed by RULE NAME with the reason as the value. Per-rule,
never per-file. No expiry, and every waiver is printed on every run — green ones included —
because an escape hatch that stops being visible becomes permanent. Rule 1 refuses to be waived.

This lives in `scripts/` and not `tests/` because one lab repo has neither `src/` nor `tests/`,
and pytest is in no default environment. Its negative tests are `tests/test_conformance.py`: one
tree per rule that violates it, because a rule that checks nothing passes the happy path and a
gate that fires on nothing looks identical to a gate that passes.
