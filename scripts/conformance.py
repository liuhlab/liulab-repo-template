"""The conformance check: the rules a Liu Lab repo keeps after it leaves the template.

    pixi run conformance
    python scripts/conformance.py [--root PATH]

It states the RULE, not the file contents — a pull model, so a repo that legitimately diverges
stays green while the shared conventions stay checked. Fifteen rules: thirteen fail, two only warn.

Three exit statuses, spelled the way `scripts/check.sh` spells its own: **0** every rule passed,
**1** it ran and a rule failed, **2** it could not run at all — no `.git` to list tracked files
from, no `pyproject.toml`, a manifest that will not parse. The last is not a repo that broke a
rule, it is a repo nothing checked, and the two want opposite answers: fix the repo, or fix the
invocation. One exit code for both sends whoever reads the log hunting a violation that is not
there.

Three things it does on purpose:

- **It collects every failure.** One run tells you everything to fix, the same idiom
  `scripts/check.sh` uses. Nothing short-circuits.
- **It names the rule and a fix.** You should never have to read this file to act on its output,
  so nothing here prints a rewritten assert.
- **It says what it did NOT check.** A rule whose premise is absent is vacuous, not failing — a
  repo with no `src/` is not a repo that failed to have tests — but a vacuous rule looks exactly
  like a passing one, so each is reported and says why.

The declared agent-facing set is `[tool.liulab.agent-docs]` in `pyproject.toml`: keys are plain
path prefixes matched against `git ls-files`, values name the Vale Length rule that applies or
`false` where none does. Rules 2 and 3 both read it, so the two consumers cannot drift.

Waivers are `[tool.liulab.waived]`, keyed by RULE NAME with the reason as the value. Per-rule,
never per-file. No expiry, and every waiver is printed on every run — green ones included —
because an escape hatch that stops being visible becomes permanent. Rule 1 refuses to be waived.

This lives in `scripts/` and not `tests/` because one lab repo has neither `src/` nor `tests/`,
and pytest is in no default environment. Its negative tests are `tests/test_conformance.py`: one
tree per rule that violates it, because a rule that checks nothing passes the happy path and a
gate that fires on nothing looks identical to a gate that passes.

#: neither happens.
PLACEHOLDER = "new" + "pkg"

#: Rule 1 and warning 14 are both gated on this directory, and it is the only discriminator either

#:
#: Rule 13 reads every one of them, not only `SITE_CONFIG`, because a repo may build more than one
#: site from one docs tree: a second configuration `INHERIT`s the first and APPENDS to its nav,
#: and the navbar the build renders carries the entries of both. A repo with one configuration
#: reads one, and this costs nothing.
#:
#: Every one of them INCLUDING a local overlay no task builds, which is the known cost. Reading
#: instead only the configurations a declared docs task names with `-f` was considered and
#: declined: pixi writes a task as a string, as `{cmd = "..."}` or as a list, so it needs a second
#: command-line parser beside rule 12's, and it would stop reading a configuration built by a

        TRACKED, like `workflows` and for the same reason: a configuration no checkout carries
        builds no site.

        EVERY one of them and not just `SITE_CONFIG`, because `INHERIT` joins navs rather than
        replacing them: a configuration that inherits another and writes a `nav:` of its own adds
        to the inherited list, and the navbar the build renders carries both. So the entries a
        build renders are the UNION across the files. A rule reading one file would pass the
        other's dead entry, and a rule merging them into a single nav would have to know which
        file won; the union needs neither, because an entry is checked where it was written. A
        repo with one configuration reads one, and this costs nothing.

        The join is ZENSICAL's: it merges an inherited configuration with `deepmerge`'s
        `always_merger`, which CONCATENATES lists. mkdocs' own `INHERIT` replaces them, so a repo
        that takes ADR 0001's fallback back to mkdocs has a child nav that wins outright — and
        the union then checks entries no build renders. It would report a dead entry in a file
        that is no longer read, which is a false failure. Revisit this with the generator.
