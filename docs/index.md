# liulab-newpkg

<!-- init-repo:begin template-docs -->
This is the Liu Lab repo template with its placeholder package still in place. The package
is called `liulab-newpkg` and imports as `newpkg`. What the template ships, and how to make a
repo from it, is on [The template](template/index.md).
<!-- init-repo:end template-docs -->

One line: what this repo is for. `init-repo` rewrites this page.

## Install it

The repo uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh) and nothing else. No pip, no conda, no uv. Clone the
repo, then:

```bash
pixi install
```

That reads `pyproject.toml` and builds the environment from the lock file, so you get the
same versions the tests ran on.

## Use it

```python
from newpkg import greet

print(greet("lab"))
```

The same thing from a shell:

```bash
pixi run newpkg greet lab
```

The [API reference](api.md) has the full list, built from the docstrings in `src/`.

## Check your work

One command runs the linters, the type checker and the tests:

```bash
pixi run check
```

It runs every step, then prints all the failures at once. Read to the bottom before you
fix anything.

The docs site is built by a separate command, because it needs a heavier environment:

```bash
pixi run docs-build
```

## Where things live

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/newpkg/` | the package |
| `tests/` | the tests |
| `docs/` | this site |
| `scripts/check.sh` | the gate every commit has to pass |
| `CONTEXT.md` | the glossary: the words this repo uses |

Some notes are written for coding agents, not for people. Conventions go under
`docs/agents/`, decision records under `docs/adr/`, and research notes under
`docs/research/`. Nothing in those three directories shows up in the menu or the search
box, and a page written there is still reachable by its own URL.
