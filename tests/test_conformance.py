"""Negative tests for `scripts/conformance.py` — one tree per rule that VIOLATES it.

A rule that checks nothing passes the happy path, and a gate that fires on nothing looks exactly
like a gate that passes. That already happened once here: overlapping Vale globs left every ADR
checked by no rule at all, with zero alerts and green CI. So the claim these tests make is not
"the template conforms" — `pixi run check` already says that — but "each rule can still fail".

Every test builds a tmp_path tree that is correct in every respect but one, and asserts the run
marks THAT rule FAIL and names the offending file. The rule name alone would prove nothing: the
status table prints all fifteen names on every run, passing or failing, so the assertions read the
status word out of the table rather than grepping the output for a name.

The exit status is checked here too, all three of it: 0, 1 when a rule failed, and 2 when the
checker could not run at all. A checker that could not run has checked nothing, and it must not
report that as a rule this repo broke.

Conformance is invoked as a SUBPROCESS, so what is under test is the command an agent runs and
CI runs, not an internal function that could be refactored into something the command no longer
calls.
