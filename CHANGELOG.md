# Changelog

Every change worth knowing about, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Version numbers are CalVer tags
of the form `vYYYY.M.PATCH`, and the tag is where the version comes from — nothing here
sets one.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The placeholder package, the pixi workspace, and the three environments.
- `scripts/check.sh`, the gate runner behind `pixi run check`: it runs every static step
  concurrently and reports all failures, not just the first. A step that passes is shown
  as a short tail and one that fails in full, the summary says how long each step took,
  and a run stopped with Ctrl-C takes its steps down with it.
- The writing gate: `vale` and `markdownlint` as steps of `check-static`, with the four
  `Lab` rules tracked in `styles/Lab/`.
- The three workflows: `ci.yml` runs the gate on every pull request, `docs.yml` publishes
  the site to `gh-pages`, and `release.yml` publishes to PyPI when a Release is published.
- `scripts/init_repo.py`, the half of `init-repo` a script can do: it renames the
  placeholder, cuts the lanes a new repo said it does not want, deletes the template's own
  files, and tags `v0.0.0`. It asks first about anything you have already edited.
- The `dogfood` job, which renders this template for all three shapes on every pull
  request and proves each new repo passes its own checks and builds its own site.
- A conformance rule that fails a publishing workflow a tag push can trigger, and the
  workflow reader it is built on: the check now parses every workflow file, its triggers
  and its steps, instead of only reading text.
- A conformance rule that fails a repo where a second resolver has been set up: a
  `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `pdm.lock` or `Pipfile` anywhere in the tree, or a `[tool.poetry]`,
  `[tool.uv]` or `[tool.pdm]` table in `pyproject.toml`. Two resolvers can disagree quietly,
  and what one of them installs is not what the gate runs in.
- A conformance rule for the Python version. The pixi pin has to meet the
  `requires-python` floor, and any tool that writes a language level down has to write that
  floor. It checks that the declarations agree, and does not count them, so a repo that
  supports a range of Python versions still passes.
- A conformance rule that fails a workflow step running a command of its own instead of
  `pixi run <task>`, or naming a task nothing declares. The step list stays in one place,
  so the command CI runs is one you can run too.
- `docs/template/index.md`, the page that says what the template ships and how to make a
  repo from it, and `mkdocs.template.yml`, which inherits `mkdocs.yml` and names the site
  after this repo while the shipped config keeps the placeholder. Both are template-only:
  `init-repo` deletes them, takes `-f mkdocs.template.yml` off the two docs tasks, and cuts
  the front page's pointer at the page.
- Docstring examples as tests. `pytest` collects the doctests in `src/` alongside `tests/`,
  so an example that has drifted from the code it documents fails the gate. Writing an
  example is voluntary; the ones that exist are checked. `docs/api.md` says how to mark a
  line that cannot run offline. Collecting `src/` imports it, so a module that needs an
  absent optional dependency costs one error instead of aborting the whole suite.
- A `validation:` block in `mkdocs.yml` turning on the five link checks the site builder
  ships switched off, and a comment beside it listing, from measurement, which broken links
  a strict build catches and which three it lets through. A `nav:` entry naming a file that
  is not there is one of the three, and no setting catches it.
- `reportMissingParameterType` beside the pyright mode, because `standard` does not check
  that a parameter is annotated at all — the bar was kept by discipline and nothing would
  have noticed a repo dropping it. Its sibling `reportUnknownParameterType` was considered
  and declined: it also fails parameters that *are* annotated when the type belongs to an
  untyped dependency, which is not a bar a lab repo can hold. `tests/` is scoped back to
  plain `standard`, because the rule fired on fixtures and `parametrize` arguments, where
  the annotation it asks for is a claim nothing compares to the fixture.
- A conformance rule that fails a `nav:` entry naming a file the repo does not track, or one
  that sits outside the site source. That is the broken site the builder does not validate
  at all — it reports no issues, exits 0, and publishes a menu item that 404s — so the check
  had to go somewhere it could be one. It reads every site config, so a repo building more
  than one site from one docs tree has both navs checked.

### Changed

- The conformance rule about a second resolver now looks for four things instead of eight: a
  `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `pdm.lock` or `Pipfile`, and the three tables that configure those
  resolvers. It no longer says anything about `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, `setup.py`
  or `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, each of which was measured failing a repo doing correct work —
  a notebook that runs on Colab needs a requirements file and cannot run pixi, and the old
  advice was to delete it. The four that remain are files a resolver writes for itself, and
  they now fail wherever they sit rather than only at the top of the repo.
- The conformance rule about the publishing trigger now reads a tag filter instead of refusing
  every one. A `push:` with no branch filter and a `create:` still fail, because an absent
  filter is every ref and neither has a correct form. A `tags:` or `tags-ignore:` filter is
  read, and it fails only where it lets the first-day `v0.0.0` tag through — so `tags:
  ['v20*']`, which CalVer versions can never match, now passes. The rule reads one path,
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`, and its own report says so: the same trigger under another
  filename is outside it.
- The conformance rule about workflow steps now lets a step pass arguments to its task, after
  `--`, and prints them on every run instead of failing. The clause that forbade them had no
  failing fixture and was refuted by the fix it prescribed: moving the flag into a task of its
  own passes the rule, so the divergence it named was already allowed through the compliant
  path. A token after the task with no `--` still fails, because pixi reads it as its own
  option, and so does a shell operator anywhere after the task. The list of pixi options that
  take a separate value was measured off `pixi run --help` and had eight spellings of twelve
  options, so `pixi run -p linux-64 build` — a step that literally is `pixi run <task>` — was
  being told it ran a command.
- The conformance rule about `nav:` entries now resolves only the entries that name a page —
  ending `.md`, `.ipynb` or `.html` — and strips a trailing `#anchor` first. A directory entry,
  an `...`, and `guide.md#install` were each measured failing a correct site, and the fix printed
  for the second was "add docs/...". Whatever it did not resolve is listed in the notes, so a
  passed-over entry is visible rather than silently uncounted.
- A site configuration that declares a page-generating plugin — `gen-files`, `literate-nav`,
  `awesome-pages`, `macros` — now reports that rule not checked, with the reason. Such a repo had
  to waive the whole rule on first contact, and a waiver is per rule: one generated section
  turned the check off for every hand-written entry it exists to protect, dead links included.
- `ci.yml`'s header no longer says CI and a laptop cannot drift. The rule reads the `run:` line
  and nothing else, so `env:`, `working-directory:`, `shell:` and a local composite action can
  each change what a step does without changing that line. Those limits are now written down in
  the rule rather than implied away.
- `conformance` now exits 2 when it could not run at all: no `.git`, no `pyproject.toml`, or
  a `pyproject.toml` it cannot read. It still exits 1 when it ran and a rule failed, and 0
  when every rule passed. Both used to exit 1, so a bad checkout looked just like a repo that
  broke a rule. The two want opposite answers: one is a repo to fix, the other is a repo that
  nothing checked. `scripts/check.sh` already used 2 that way.
